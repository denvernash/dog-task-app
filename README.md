dawg is a task management app designed to help pet owners keep track of the daily, weekly, and monthly needs of their pets.

Users can create a profile for each of their pets and then create recurring checklists to stay on top of each pet's daily needs (like walks), weekly needs (like medication), and monthly needs (like grooming).
